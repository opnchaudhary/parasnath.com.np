I"f<p>After been using Ubuntu/Fedora alternately one after the other for couple of years, I decided to use Arch Linux because of its concept of rolling-release unlike Ubuntu/Fedora. So on February 23rd I installed Arch on my system. It was working all good till June 11,2016 evening. When I suddenly bumped into an error when I booted up my system. I don’t know what cause the error. As far as I remember , I forgot the update that was running in my guake terminal last time when I shutdown my computer. And then when I came back to turn it on. I had this error on my screen:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Warning: /lib/modules/4.6.2-1-Arch/modules-.devname not found <span class="nt">--ignoring</span>
starting version 229
Error : device <span class="s1">'UUID=xxxxxx-xxxx-xxx-xxx-xxxxxx'</span> not found skipping fsck.
Error: Unable to find root device <span class="s1">'UUID=xxxxxx-xxxx-xxx-xxx-xxxxxx'</span><span class="nb">.</span>
Youre are being dropped to a recovery shell
    Type <span class="s1">'exit'</span> to try and <span class="k">continue </span>booting
sh: can<span class="s1">'t access tty: job control tunred off
[rootfs]#_ 
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>First thing I tried to do was type ‘help’ in the shell presented; the keyboard didn’t respond. I was clueless. And then I started searching for this error in different forums for a fix. And somewhere I saw ‘# mkinitcpio -p linux’ should fix it. So what I did was create bootable usb with the command.</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c">#dd if=arch.iso of=/dev/rdisk2 bs=1m</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>You can find the USB installation guide at : https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/USB_flash_installation_media.
After booting my pc with the bootable USB. I was automatically logged in as root of the usb bootable system. I did a quick check to see the name of my drive using the command :</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> root@archiso~# fdisk <span class="nt">-l</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>I could see my partitions there the way I had set, so I went to ahead to mount my drives(root drive was /dev/sda2) and use the swap (swap was /dev/sda1).</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> root@archiso~# mount /dev/sda2 /mnt
root@archiso~# swapon /dev/sda1 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then I ch-rooted into my system using the command:</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> root@archiso~# arch-root /mnt
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>And then I installed grub to my hard drive. The command to install is:</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> sh-4.3# grub-install /dev/sda
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>After grub was installed to the drive, I generated the init file with the command below:</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> sh-4.3# mkinitcpio <span class="nt">-p</span> linux
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>To generate grub configuration file I ran command:</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> sh-4.3#grub-mkconfig <span class="nt">-o</span> /boot/grub/grub.cfg
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>After that I exited from the ch-root with the command exit
Then I unmount my drive with the command:</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> root@archiso~#umount /mnt
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>and rebooted my system.
My system was all running back again.Hope this post can help you resecue your system from similar situtation.</p>
