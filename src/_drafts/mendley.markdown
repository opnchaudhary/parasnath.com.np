Are you working on your Thesis Dissertation? Are you overwhelmed by the number of research papers and references you have to read and keep track of? In this post, I am going to share a tool that is going to make this hassle ease.

I am currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Engineering. To graduate with a Master's degree, I will have to submit a thesis dissertation. Writing a thesis is not that easy. I keep reading a ton of research papers. It's very important to cite the original author's work while using references in the thesis. Besides, I also want to get back to the paper or article whenever I want as easily as possible.

To all these kinds of problem, a tool called Mendeley came to resuce. Here in this post, I want to introduce the tool I use to you, which is called Mendeley. Mendeley is a reference manager which is used to manage and share research papers and generate bibliographies. It is an academic social network.

Mendeley is available for [Windows](https://www.mendeley.com/download-desktop/Windows), [Mac](https://www.mendeley.com/download-desktop/Mac%20OS), [Linux](https://www.mendeley.com/download-desktop/Linux) and [Web](https://www.mendeley.com/). 

However, if you are Arch Linux or Manjaro user like me then you can install it from AUR. I use yaourt to install packages from AUR. So, if you do so run the following command to install Menedley.
```bash
# yaourt -S mendeleydesktop
```
