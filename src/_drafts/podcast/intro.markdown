## Intro
Hello there,

This is the first podcast I am recording. And I am your host Paras Nath. 

I am a student of Computer Science and I created this podcast to share my learning and learnings. That means, most of my podcast would be related to technology. Each of my podcast in this series would be short i.e. around 10-15 minutes. And this one would be even short around 2-3 minutes.

## Format of the pocast
This podcast will have a single host i.e. me and possibly no guest. I will definitely see if I can have some guest or a co-host in my future podcast. As far as I see know, I will be the sole host. The format of my talk would be narrative.


## Disclaimer  
Everything I talk about and share here is based on what I have observed, experienced and learnt from various sources.
