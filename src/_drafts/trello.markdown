Trello is a web-based Kanban-style list-making application which is a subsidiary of Atlassian.

## How I use Trello?
I create different boards for the different purposes. Then I have a set of lists to organize my cards. I usually have a Backlog, TODO, Working, Completed.
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
### Backlog  
Backlog is a list where I dump all the tasks that I have to complete. Each task dumped in to this list will also be labelled with different labels to denote the priority of the task.
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
### TODO
TODO is a list of cards containing the tasks that I need to complete in the respective week. I pull the cards from Backlog to this list.
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
### Working
This is a list of cards which contains the task that I am currently working on. I don't have a lot of tasks at a time in this list.
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
### Completed
Next when the tasks are complete, I move the cards to this list.
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
This way I am able to have a quick view of all the tasks and their statuses.
