I have been inspired by [Philipp Hansch's blog](https://phansch.net/) about writing a monthly review. I want to take this as an opportunity to take a look back at the month and look forward to the next month so that I can learn from my past and make the future better. I believe it will be a moment for me to reflect on my own activities. So let's get started.

Looking back in January, I am glad to have performed the following activities:
* Published a few posts for my blog
    * [Load balancing with Pound](https://parasnath.com.np/blog/load-balancing-with-pound/)
    * [Using Custom fonts with Flutter](https://parasnath.com.np/blog/)
    * [Setting up lamp server along with reverse proxy using Nginx](https://parasnath.com.np)
* Optimized SEO of my blog post
* Prepared and attended [PSC](http://psc.gov.np/) practical exam
* At work:
    * Finished a security audit report
    * Deployed CRM application in CentOS using docker
    * Studied about [OWASP Top 10 Proactive Controls V3](https://www.owasp.org/images/b/bc/OWASP_Top_10_Proactive_Controls_V3.pdf) 

What I want to achieve in February:
